I am very satisfied with my work on this assignment. This is the first of any of my front-end projects that I have though of as asthetically pleasing. I also like the fact that it can still be programatically generated with ease. This is also the first of the projects for this class to replace my real-world personal site. I did not add javascript/css transitions to this site, which is something that I plan to do in the future, especially for the page which lists servers. I could use websockets to tell if they were up or not and display status. 


NOTE: This site uses apache index header fragmnets. I am not sure if the nodejs servelet can handle it. There is a live version at https://ballmerlabs.net
